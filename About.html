          <h3>Art3mis Prime</h3>
          <p>Art3mis Prime is a lyricist, singer and songwriter from Brooklyn, NYC currently residing in Oakland, CA. Drawing influences from a variety of genres, including heavy metal, hardcore, punk and salsa, Art3mis's lyrics often include nods to other artists or references to books, movies and video games. Aside from creating hip hop music, Art3mis has fronted a hardcore band, is currently lead vocals/songwriter for a heavy metal project called Transcend The Architect, collaborated with psychedelic cumbia band Mala Grena and also lends vocals to Puerto Rican bomba ensemble, Taller Bombalele. 
Art3mis released her debut mixtape in 2017 despite being a rapper since the mid 90's. The 16 track mixtape was named City Baby as an homage to being born and raised in New York as well as it being her favorite GBH song, <em>City Baby Attacked By Rats</em>. The City Baby mixtape included a variety of instrumentals borrowed from personal favorites such as Portishead, Wax Tailor and BADBADNOTGOOD. Her latest EP, Algorithm & Blues, is much shorter at only 7 tracks but took a more personal and intimate tone with tracks like Daddy's Girl, dedicated to her late father, and the interlude Time's Up which takes on the #MeToo movement. Art3mis is currently working on her third studio album..</p>
